# RISC-V-Simulator-NexysA7-Board

The project is to design and implement a pipelined RISC-V processor (femtoRV32) that supports the RV32I instruction set, with specific modifications, and to test it on our Nexys A7 FPGA board. The implementation will be fully tested using a custom set of test cases covering all supported instructions.
